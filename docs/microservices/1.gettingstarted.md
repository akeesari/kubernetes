# Chapter-1: Getting started with Microservices

## Overview

This is our first chapter of the book, In this chapter you will create few Microservices applications, create few MicroFrontend applications, Containerize these applications, push to Container Registry and prepare these applications for Kubernetes deployment.

## Microservices Architecture

 `Building Microservices Architecture` requires a solid understanding of the Microservices architecture and the technology stack, as well as careful planning and implementation of the individual services. With the right approach, however, microservices can help you build flexible, scalable, and maintainable applications.

In general building true microservices architecture needs good understand and theoretical and practical knowledge, We will not be able to dig deeper to understand theoretical concepts of microservices architecture here instead we will focus on creating few Microservices & MicroFrontend applications to show the microservices architecture pattern while deploying in Kubernetes cluster using ArgoCD and Helm Chart.

This book assumes that you've good understand on Microservices Architecture and some experience in building, deploying and managing applications.

Let's quickly recap very hight level what is Microservices before start the labs.
 

`Microservices` - It is an architectural style for developing modern applications. Microservices allow a large application to be separated into smaller independent parts.

- Microservices architecture =  Microservices
- Microservices are small, independent, and loosely coupled. 
- A single small team of developers can write and maintain a service.
- Each service is self-contained 
- Each service should implement a single business capability within a bounded context. 
- Each service is a separate codebase, which can be managed by a small development team.
- Services are responsible for persisting their own data or external state

## Objective

In this lab we will do some planning and preparation on the Microservices and MicroFrontend applications we are going to create in our next labs. In general building Microservices architecture needs good planning and preparation before even starts coding.

This module will help you to understand how many microservices we are going to create in subsequent labs and how they are organized.

In this exercise we will accomplish & learn on following:

- **Task-1:** Identity list of business domains / microservices
- **Task-2:** Identity list of git repos needed 
- **Task-3:** Identity list of applications needed
- **Task-4:** Create DevOps Organization - Lab
- **Task-5:** Create DevOps Project - Lab
  
## Task-1: Identity list of business domains / microservices

One of the complex part of the Microservices architecture is, identifying the list of microservices needed. Services should be organized around business capabilities, and each service should have a clear and well-defined responsibility.

use the below link to understand and analyze your business domains and define the bounded context for your Microservices architecture etc..

<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/microservices/model/domain-analysis>

In this book my focus is not implementing any real world microservices scenarios instead we will create few Microservices and assume that they are belongs to separate business domains and defined using bounded context. 

 For example we will take hypothetical scenario here and assume you've 3 domains like below:

- Domain-1
- Domain-2
- Domain-3

At this point you've finalized your business domains for your Microservices Architecture so that the rest of the design and implementation will depend on these domains.

## Task-2: Identity list of git repos needed

Once you know the list of domains or Microservices needed for your project then, it is time to analyze how they will be organized in the source control system like git repo. one of the questions you can ask your self is how many git repo you need? 

there are multiple ways to organize the source code and pipelines in the azure DevOps git. it is all depends on how you want to manage your source code and pipelines for your microservices architecture, how easy to maintain in the future.

My preference here would be create separate git repo for each domain or Microservice. Each domain can have multiple microservices, MicroFrontends and databases in it. 

For example, Here is how git structure may looks like:

- Organization1 (Name of your organization)
  - Project1 (Name of the project)
    - Repo-1 (specific Domain1, Name of the repo for each domain, I'd keep all the repos in lower case)
        - APIs - create one or more APIs with separate folder
        - Websites -create  one or more websites with separate folder
        - Databases - create one or more databases with separate folder
    - Repo-2 (Domain2 specific)
        - APIs - create one or more APIs with separate folder
        - Websites - create one or more APIs with separate folder
        - Databases - create one or more APIs with separate folder
    - Repo-3 (Domain3 specific)
        - APIs - create one or more APIs with separate folder
        - Websites - create one or more APIs with separate folder
        - Databases - create one or more APIs with separate folder
  - Project2 (Project2 is completely different from project1)
    - Repo-1 (Name of the repo under Project2)
        - APIs - create one or more APIs with separate folder
        - Websites - create one or more APIs with separate folder
        - Databases - create one or more APIs with separate folder

repeat the structure as the organization grows.

for example, here is how the sample DevOps git structure looks like:

``` sh
Organization1
├── Project1
│   ├── Repo-1
│   │   ├── APIs
│   │   ├── Websites
│   │   └── Databases
│   ├── Repo-2
│   │   ├── APIs
│   │   ├── Websites
│   │   └── Databases
│   └── Repo-3
│       ├── APIs
│       ├── Websites
│       └── Databases
├── Project2
│   ├── Repo-1
│   │   ├── APIs
│   │   ├── Websites
│   │   └── Databases
│   ├── Repo-2
│   │   ├── APIs
│   │   ├── Websites
│   │   └── Databases

```

That's it! at this point you've finalized the source control structure for Microservices Architecture so that you know how to create new repos if someone ask for new services.

## Task-3: Identity list of Applications needed

Let's use this task to list all Microservices applications we are going to create in the next labs and how they will be structured.

Here is the list of applications that we will be creating in this book to get the feeling of Microservices architecture pattern. Here we've purposely selected different technology stack to cover more learning scenarios and to get true Microservice feeling. Microservices can be built using a variety of technology stacks. Some popular choices include .NET Core, Node.js, Java, and Python etc..


- Create the first Microservice with .NET Core Web API with C#
    - name of the api is called `aspnet-api`
- Create the second Microservice with Node JS (Node)
    - name of the api is called  `nodejs-api`
- Create the first website with ASP.NET Core MVC (C#)
    - name of the app is called `aspnet-app`
- Create the second website with React JS (Node)
    - name of the app is called `react-app`
- Create the third website with Blazor (C#)
    - name of the app is called `blazor-app`
- Create first database with SQL server
    - name of the database app is called `sqlserver-db`
- Create second database with PostgreSQL
    - name of the database app is called `postgresql-db`

<!-- 
    - Create the third Microservice with Java 
    - name of the api is called `java-api` 

-->

for example, here is how the folder structure of our Microservices and MicroFrontend Applications looks like    .

```sh
Microservices/
├── aspnet-api/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── appsettings.json
│   ├── Program.cs
│   ├── Startup.cs
│   └── Dockerfile
│   └── aspnet-api.csproj
├── nodejs-api/
│   ├── routes/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── app.js
│   └── Dockerfile
└── java-api/
    ├── src/
    ├── pom.xml
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── README.md
Websites/
├── aspnet-app/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Views/
│   ├── appsettings.json
│   ├── Program.cs
│   ├── Startup.cs
│   └── Dockerfile
│   └── aspnet-app.csproj
├── reactjs-app/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public/
│   └── Dockerfile
│   ├── node_modules/
│   └── README.md
└── blazor-app/
    ├── Pages/
    ├── Data/
    |── Dockerfile
    ├── blazor-app.sln
    ├── blazor-app.csproj
    └── README.md
Databases/
├── sqlserver-db/
│   ├── tables/
│   ├── procedures/
│   ├── views/
│   ├── functions/
│   └── triggers/
│   └── Dockerfile
|
└── postgresql-db/
    ├── tables/
    ├── procedures/
    ├── views/
    ├── functions/
    |── Dockerfile
    └── triggers/
    
```
!!! Important 
    One thing if you noticed, every project has own `Dockerfile` in it, that means, all these applications will be containerized and deployed to Kubernetes cluster.

## Task-4: Create new Azure DevOps Organization

Now you are done with planning and preparation of your Microservices application, so what is ne? you need `DevOps Organization` so that you can mange your project lifecycle.

To create a new Azure DevOps organization, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Azure DevOps. - <https://dev.azure.com>
2. Click on `New organization` in the left nav.

3. Enter name of the Organization and create new organization.
![image.jpg](images/image-9.jpg)

Once you have completed these steps, you will have a new Azure DevOps organization that is ready for use. You can then invite members to join your organization and start creating new projects.

## Task-5: Create new Azure DevOps Project

You need a new project in Azure DevOps to manage your source code and other project related activities.

Follow these steps to create a new project in Azure DevOps:

1. Sign in to the Azure DevOps website <https://dev.azure.com/> with your Azure DevOps account.

2. Click on the `Create a project` button.

3. Enter a name for your project and select a process template. The process template determines the default work item types, source control repository, and other settings for your project.

4. Click the `Create project` button to create your new project.

5. Follow the screen to configure your project settings, including source control, work item types, and team members.

6. When you are finished, click the `Create` button to complete the project creation process.

For example: 

Project Name - `Microservices`

Description - `Microservices project will be used to roll out sample microservices applications for demonstrating microservices architecture.`
