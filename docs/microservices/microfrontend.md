## Introduction

In our previous labs we've created couple of Microservices to the show the Microservices architecture pattern, same pattern is applicable for Microfrontend applications; In this lab we are going to focus on Microfrontend Applications.

Let's try to understand some basic concepts of Microfrontend here before start creating frontend applications.

## Waht is Microfrontend?

`Microfrontend` is a web development approach that involves breaking down a frontend monolith into smaller, more manageable parts, called microfrontends. Microfrontends are individual, self-contained parts of a user interface that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently from one another. Each microfrontend is responsible for a specific feature or functionality of the overall application. When combined, these microfrontends make up the complete user interface of the application.

One of the key benefits of microfrontend is that it allows developers to work on different parts of the application independently, without disrupting the work of others. This approach also makes it easier to scale and maintain large web applications, as changes can be made to specific microfrontends without affecting the entire application. Additionally, microfrontends can be reused across different applications, further reducing development time and costs.

## Microfrontend architecture

In Microfrontend architecture, the user interface is composed of multiple Microfrontend that are combined at runtime to create a cohesive, functional application. Each microfrontend is responsible for rendering a specific part of the UI and communicating with other Microfrontends through well-defined interfaces.

Microfrontend architecture allows developers to work on individual parts of an application in isolation, without worrying about how changes in one part might affect other parts. This makes it easier to scale development teams, reuse code, and add new features to an application without disrupting the entire system.

Overall, Microfrontend is a relatively new approach to frontend development that is gaining popularity due to its flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance.

## Benefits of Microfrontend architecture

There are several benefits of using a microfrontend architecture to build web applications:

- **Independent Development:** One of the main advantages of microfrontend architecture is that it allows developers to work independently on different parts of the application without interfering with each other's work. This leads to faster development cycles, as teams can work in parallel, resulting in faster time-to-market.

- **Scalability:** Microfrontend architecture makes it easier to scale web applications. Since each microfrontend is responsible for a specific functionality or feature, it can be easily replaced, updated or scaled independently without affecting the other parts of the application.

- **Reusability:** The modular nature of microfrontend architecture makes it possible to reuse components across different applications. This reduces development time and costs as the components can be developed once and reused multiple times.

- **Improved User Experience:** Microfrontend architecture allows developers to create smaller, more focused user interfaces that are optimized for specific use cases. This results in a better user experience as users only see the features they need, and the application is faster and more responsive.

- **Reduced Code Complexity:** Microfrontend architecture can help to reduce code complexity by breaking down complex monolithic applications into smaller, more manageable parts. This makes it easier to maintain and update the application over time.

- **Technology Agnostic:** Microfrontend architecture allows developers to choose the best technology for each microfrontend. This means that different teams can use different technologies and frameworks without affecting the overall application.

Overall, microfrontend architecture provides a more modular, scalable, and efficient way to build web applications, allowing teams to work faster and more effectively while improving the user experience.
