#  Running Keycloak in a Docker Container: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction


Welcome to our latest lab in the Microservices chapter! In this lab, I will guide you through the process of creating a Docker container using a Dockerfile and running Keycloak inside it.

The objective is to establish a local development environment for Keycloak, an identity and access management solution, in preparation for future deployment in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). To accomplish this, you will create a Docker container image for Keycloak, run it locally, and subsequently push the image to an Azure Container Registry (ACR). This streamlined deployment process will be explored in more detail in upcoming chapters.

Keycloak is a popular open-source identity and access management solution that enables you to secure your applications and services.

If you are new to Keycloak and would like to learn more, you can refer to my article on [Getting Started with Keycloak](https://anjikeesari.com/articles/keycloak/){:target="_blank"}


## Technical Scenario

Technical Scenario: Securing Microservices with Keycloak in a Microservices Architecture

As an `Application Architect`, you are responsible for securing a complex microservices architecture using Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution. Your goal is to implement authentication and authorization mechanisms across the microservices, ensuring that only authorized users and services can access specific resources. 


Here are some Keycloak requirements within microservices architecture:

- **Microservices architecture**:
   You have a microservices architecture consisting of multiple services, each responsible for specific functionalities.
   Services include user-facing web applications, APIs, and backend services.

- **Keycloak integration**:
   Integrate Keycloak into the microservices architecture to provide authentication and authorization capabilities.
   Keycloak should act as the central identity provider for all microservices.

3. **User management**:
   Implement user management within Keycloak, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
   Define user roles and groups for fine-grained access control.

4. **Secure API endpoints**:
   Protect API endpoints to ensure that only authenticated users or services with the appropriate permissions can access them.
   Implement OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for securing APIs.

5. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:
   Keycloak can serve as a versatile solution for enabling SSO between companies by establishing federated trust relationships between IdPs and SPs. This approach simplifies user access across organizations, enhances security, and provides a seamless user experience when accessing services and applications from different companies.

6. **JWT Tokens**:
   Utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure communication between microservices and Keycloak.
   Configure token expiration, signing, and validation.

## Objective

In this exercise, our objective is to accomplish and learn the following tasks:

- **Step-1:** Setup repository for Keycloak in Azure DevOps.
- **Step-2:** Create Keycloak project.
- **Step-3:** Add Dockerfiles to the Keycloak project.
- **Step-4:** Docker build locally.
- **Step-5:** Docker run locally.
- **Step-6:** Publish the Keycloak docker container to container registry.

## Step-1: Setup repository for Keycloak in Azure DevOps

Before you begin with the Keycloak setup, it's necessary to have a version control repository to manage your project. Here's how to set it up:

Create Azure DevOps Project: If you don't already have an Azure DevOps project, create one. This project will host your keycloak code, including Dockerfiles and any other project-related files.

Initialize Repository: In your Azure DevOps project, initialize a Git repository to track changes.

For this Keycloak application, we can either use an existing git repository created in our first chapter or initiate a new one.

To clone an existing repository, run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://keesari.visualstudio.com/Microservices/_git/microservices
```

## Step-2: Create Keycloak project

In this step, we'll create a dedicated project for our Keycloak application

Create a New Project: Inside our Git repository, create a new directory or folder specifically for your Keycloak project. This folder will contain all the necessary files for Keycloak, including Dockerfiles and configurations.


## Step-3: Add Dockerfiles to the Keycloak project.

To containerize our Keycloak application, let's create a Dockerfile in the root directory of our project and include the following code. The Dockerfile provides instructions for building a container image of our keycloak application.

``` Dockerfile
# Use an official OpenJDK runtime as a parent image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim

# Set the Keycloak version you want to use
ENV KEYCLOAK_VERSION 16.1.0

# Set the Keycloak distribution URL
ENV KEYCLOAK_DIST_URL https://downloads.jboss.org/keycloak/${KEYCLOAK_VERSION}/keycloak-${KEYCLOAK_VERSION}.tar.gz

# Create a directory for Keycloak
RUN mkdir -p /opt/keycloak

# Download and extract Keycloak
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl && \
    curl -L ${KEYCLOAK_DIST_URL} | tar xz --strip-components=1 -C /opt/keycloak && \
    apt-get remove -y curl && \
    apt-get autoremove -y && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Expose ports for Keycloak HTTP and HTTPS
EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 8443

# Set the Keycloak admin credentials (customize these as needed)
ENV KEYCLOAK_USER admin
ENV KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD admin

# Start Keycloak
CMD ["/opt/keycloak/bin/standalone.sh", "-b", "0.0.0.0", "-Dkeycloak.migration.action=import", "-Dkeycloak.migration.provider=singleFile", "-Dkeycloak.migration.file=/opt/keycloak/your-realm-export.json"]

```

## Step-4: Docker build locally

We will build the Docker container locally using the Dockerfiles and ensure that the containerized application working as expected.

The `docker build` command is used to build Docker images from a Dockerfile.  

```
docker build -t sample/keycloak-app:20240101.1 .
```

output

```sh
Docker build output goes here
```

When you run the `docker build` command, Docker looks for a Dockerfile in the specified directory and reads the instructions in the file to build a new image. 

The Dockerfile contains a series of instructions that define how to build the image, such as copying files, running commands, and setting environment variables. 

## Step-5: Docker run locally

Run the Docker container locally to verify that the keycloak application working correctly within a containerized environment. This step ensures that the containerized keycloak application works as expected on your local machine.

Run the `docker run` command to start a container based on the image:

```
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 sample/keycloak-app:20240101.1 .
```
output

``` sh
Docker run output goes here
```
if you open the docker desktop you will notice the new image & container started running.

## Step-6: Publish the Keycloak docker container to container registry

Now that we have Keycloak Docker container ready locally, it's time to push them to the Container Registry for future deployment on Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS). This step is importent for preparing the container for deployment in a cloud environment.

To publish a Keycloak Docker container to Azure Container Registry (ACR), you will need to have the following:

1. Create an Azure Container Registry. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the instructions in the Azure Portal or using Azure CLI.
2. Log in to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
``` sh
# azure Login
az login

# set the azure subscription
az account set -s "anji.keesari"

# Log in to the container registry
az acr login --name acr1dev
# Login Succeeded
# To get the login server address for verification
az acr list --resource-group rg-acr-dev --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table

# output should look similar to this.

# AcrLoginServer    
# ------------------
# acr1dev.azurecr.io
```
list all the Docker images that are available on the local system
```
docker images
```
output
```
REPOSITORY                                                TAG                                                                          IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
sample/keycloak-app                                         20230312.1                                                                   587f347206bc   8 minutes ago   216MB
.
.
.
```
1. `Tag` your Docker container image with the full name of your Azure Container Registry, including the repository name and the version tag. You can do this by running the following command:
```
docker tag sample/keycloak-app:20240101.1 acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/keycloak-app:20240101.1
```
1. Push your Docker container image to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
```
docker push acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/keycloak-app:20240101.1
```
Output
``` sh
The push refers to repository [acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/keycloak-app]
649a035a1734: Pushed

```
1. Wait for the push to complete. Depending on the size of your Docker container image and the speed of your internet connection, this may take a few minutes.
1. Verify the newly pushed image to ACR.
``` sh
az acr repository list --name acr1dev --output table
```
Output
```
Result
-------------------------------
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk
sample/aspnet-api
sample/aspnet-app
sample/node-api
sample/postgresql-db
sample/keycloak-app
```
1. Show the new tags of a image in the acr
```
az acr repository show-tags --name acr1dev --repository sample/keycloak-app --output table
```
output
```
Result
----------
20240101.1
```

You've successfully pushed your Docker container image to Azure Container Registry. You can now use the Azure Portal or Azure CLI to manage your container images and deploy them to Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Conclusion

You have successfully created a Docker container for keycloak application, container created as part of this task will be used in the future labs in AKS.
