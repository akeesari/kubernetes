# Getting started with Microservices

## Overview

Welcome to the first chapter of our book. In this chapter, we will start on a hands-on journey where you will create multiple containerized microservices applications, develop microfrontend applications, containerize these applications, push them to a Container Registry, and prepare them for deployment on Kubernetes.

## Microservices

Before diving into the labs, let's briefly recap what microservices are at a high level.

`Microservices` is an architectural style that enables the development of modern applications. It involves breaking down a large application into smaller, independent parts called microservices.

Key Characteristics of Microservices Architecture:

- **Small, Independent, and Loosely Coupled:** Microservices are designed to be small and focused on specific business capabilities. They are independent entities that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually. This loose coupling allows for greater flexibility and agility.

- **Self-Contained Services:** Each microservice is self-contained and encapsulates a specific functionality or feature. It can be developed and maintained by a small team of developers, promoting autonomy and faster iteration.

- **Bounded Context and Business Capabilities:** Microservices are designed to implement a single business capability within a bounded context. They are responsible for a specific task or function and should strive to be cohesive and aligned with a well-defined domain.

- **Separate Codebases and Teams:** Each microservice has its own separate codebase, enabling independent development and deployment. A small development team can manage and maintain a microservice, fostering ownership and accountability.

- **Data and State Responsibility:** Microservices are responsible for persisting their own data or managing external state relevant to their specific functionality. This allows for better encapsulation and isolation of data within each microservice.

By using microservices architecture, organizations can achieve greater scalability, maintainability, and resilience in their applications. It promotes modularity, enables independent development and deployment, and supports the evolution of complex systems.

In the labs ahead, we will explore the practical implementation of microservices using Kubernetes and related tools. Let's continue our journey and delve deeper into building and deploying microservices in a distributed environment.

## Task-1: Identify Microservices List:

To fully explore the microservices architecture in this book, we will create several containerized microservices and microfrontend applications and couple of databases. These applications will allow us to demonstrate real-world scenarios and provide a practical understanding of microservices implementation. In this case study, we will create the following microservices, which will be developed in the upcoming labs.  we have purposely selected diverse options to ensure a broader learning experience.


- Create the first containerized microservice with .NET Core Web API with C#
    - name of the api is called `aspnet-api`
- Create the second containerized microservice with Node JS (Node)
    - name of the api is called  `nodejs-api`
- Create the first containerized website with ASP.NET Core MVC (C#)
    - name of the app is called `aspnet-app`
- Create the second containerized website with React JS (Node)
    - name of the app is called `react-app`
- Create the third containerized website with Blazor (C#)
    - name of the app is called `blazor-app`
- Create first containerized database with SQL server
    - name of the database app is called `sqlserver-db`
- Create second containerized database with PostgreSQL
    - name of the database app is called `postgresql-db`

<!-- 
    - Create the third Microservice with Java 
    - name of the api is called `java-api` 

-->

for example, here is how the folder structure of our Microservices and MicroFrontend Applications looks like    .

```sh
Microservices/
├── aspnet-api/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── appsettings.json
│   ├── Program.cs
│   ├── Startup.cs
│   └── Dockerfile
│   └── aspnet-api.csproj
└── node-api/
    ├── routes/
    ├── models/
    ├── package.json
    ├── app.js
    └── Dockerfile

Websites/
├── aspnet-app/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Views/
│   ├── appsettings.json
│   ├── Program.cs
│   ├── Startup.cs
│   └── Dockerfile
│   └── aspnet-app.csproj
├── react-app/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── public/
│   └── Dockerfile
│   ├── node_modules/
│   └── README.md
└── blazor-app/
    ├── Pages/
    ├── Data/
    |── Dockerfile
    ├── blazor-app.sln
    ├── blazor-app.csproj
    └── README.md
Databases/
├── sqlserver-db/
│   ├── tables/
│   ├── procedures/
│   ├── views/
│   ├── functions/
│   └── triggers/
│   └── Dockerfile
|
└── postgresql-db/
    ├── tables/
    ├── procedures/
    ├── views/
    ├── functions/
    |── Dockerfile
    └── triggers/
    
```
!!! Important 
    If you noticed, each project has its own `Dockerfile`, indicating that all these applications will be containerized and ready for deployment to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Task-2: Identify the List of Git Repositories Needed

Once you have determined the list of domains or microservices required for your project, it's time to analyze how they will be organized within the source control system, such as Git repositories. One important consideration is determining the number of Git repositories you need.

There are multiple ways to organize source code and pipelines in Azure DevOps Git, and the approach you choose depends on how you want to manage your source code and pipelines for your microservices architecture while ensuring ease of maintenance in the future.

In my preference, I recommend creating a separate Git repository for each domain or microservice. Within each domain, you may have multiple microservices, MicroFrontends, and databases.

For example, let's visualize how the Git structure may look:

- Organization1 (Name of your organization)
    - Project1 (Name of the project)
        - Repo-1 (for Domain1)
            - APIs - Create one or more APIs with separate folders
            - Websites - Create one or more websites with separate folders
            - Databases - Create one or more databases with separate folders
        - Repo-2 (for Domain2)
            - APIs - Create one or more APIs with separate folders
            - Websites - Create one or more websites with separate folders
            - Databases - Create one or more databases with separate folders
        - Repo-3 (for Domain3)
            - APIs - Create one or more APIs with separate folders
            - Websites - Create one or more websites with separate folders
            - Databases - Create one or more databases with separate folders
    - Project2 (Project2)
        - Repo-1 (Name of the repository under Project2)
            - APIs - Create one or more APIs with separate folders
            - Websites - Create one or more websites with separate folders
            - Databases - Create one or more databases with separate folders


Repeat this structure as the organization grows and new projects or domains are introduced.

By following this approach, each domain or microservice will have its dedicated Git repository, providing a clear separation and organization of the source code and related artifacts. This structure facilitates easier maintenance, collaboration, and version control.

Remember, this is just a sample structure, and you can adapt it based on your organization's specific needs and preferences.

Visual representation of a sample DevOps Git structure:
```sh
Organization1
└── Project1
    ├── Repo-1
    │   ├── APIs
    │   ├── Websites
    │   └── Databases
    ├── Repo-2
    │   ├── APIs
    │   ├── Websites
    │   └── Databases
    ├── Repo-3
    │   ├── APIs
    │   ├── Websites
    │   └── Databases
    Project2
    └── Repo-1
        ├── APIs
        ├── Websites
        └── Databases
```

By adopting this Git structure, you can effectively manage and scale your microservices projects while ensuring a clear and organized source control system.

## Task-3: Create new Azure DevOps Organization

With the planning and preparation of your Microservices application complete, the next step is to create a DevOps organization where you can manage the lifecycle of your projects.

To create a new Azure DevOps organization, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to Azure DevOps. - <https://dev.azure.com>
2. Click on `New organization` in the left nav.
![image.jpg](images/image-8.jpg)
3. Enter name of the Organization and create new organization.
![image.jpg](images/image-9.jpg)

Once you have completed these steps, you will have a new Azure DevOps organization that is ready for use. You can then invite members to join your organization and start creating new projects.

## Task-4: Create new Azure DevOps Project

You need a new project in Azure DevOps to manage your source code and other project related activities.

Follow these steps to create a new project in Azure DevOps:

1. Sign in to the Azure DevOps website <https://dev.azure.com/> with your Azure DevOps account.

2. Click on the `Create a project` button.

3. Enter a name for your project and select a process template. The process template determines the default work item types, source control repository, and other settings for your project.

4. Click the `Create project` button to create your new project.

5. Follow the screen to configure your project settings, including source control, work item types, and team members.

6. When you are finished, click the `Create` button to complete the project creation process.

For example: 

Project Name - `Microservices`

Description - `Microservices project will be used to roll out sample microservices applications for demonstrating microservices architecture.`
