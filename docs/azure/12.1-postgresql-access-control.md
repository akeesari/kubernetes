# Streamlining PostgreSQL Database Access Control Permissions with Azure AD Groups

## Introduction


PostgreSQL Database Access control permissions are something critical for every single project, ensuring that the right individuals have the appropriate level of access to the database resources they need. 

In this hands-on lab, I'll guide you through the process of creating and streamlining PostgreSQL Database access control permissions with Azure AD Groups.

## Technical Scenario


As a `Database Administrator` (DBA), the objective is to enhance the security and access control of our PostgreSQL databases through the effective utilization of Azure AD groups. This initiative aims to streamline user management and elevate overall database permission control.

Streamlining PostgreSQL Database Access Control includes:

**Azure AD Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with Azure Active Directory for our PostgreSQL database hosted on Azure.
  
**Role Assignment with Azure AD Groups:** Allow DBAs to associate Azure AD groups with specific roles in PostgreSQL.
  
**User Onboarding and Permissions:** Enable DBAs to onboard new users by adding them to relevant Azure AD groups.
   
**Access Revocation:** Provide a mechanism for DBAs to remove users from Azure AD groups, promptly revoking their access to the PostgreSQL database.

## Fundamental Concepts

Let's take look into some fundamental concepts before jumping into practical details:

**Default PostgreSQL Database Roles:**

When you set up an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server, it automatically configures three default roles. To identify these roles, you can execute the following command:

```sql
SELECT rolname FROM pg_roles;
```

**azure_pg_admin:** This role includes your server admin user. However, note that the server admin account doesn't inherently possess the `azure_superuser` role. It plays a crucial administrative role in managing the PostgreSQL server.

**azure_superuser ("azuresu"):** Reserved exclusively for Microsoft due to the managed nature of this Platform as a Service (PaaS) offering. The `azure_superuser` role provides elevated privileges necessary for overseeing and maintaining the entire PostgreSQL service.

**Server Admin User (postgres):** This represents the username linked to the administrator account you specified during the initial creation of your Azure Database for PostgreSQL. It's essential for day-to-day administrative tasks within your specific database.

For example server admin user details will look like below:

```sh
- Default Username: postgres
- Password: password1234 (Configured during PostgreSQL server creation)
```


In the PostgreSQL engine, privileges govern access to database objects. In Azure Database for PostgreSQL, the server admin user has the following privileges: LOGIN, NOSUPERUSER, INHERIT, CREATEDB, CREATEROLE, and REPLICATION.

The server admin user can create new users and assign them to the azure_pg_admin role. Additionally, it can establish users and roles with varying privilege levels, enabling access to specific databases and schemas based on organizational needs.


## Architecture diagram 

The following reference diagram from Microsoft MSDN documentation explains the highrarchy of roles and access controls within the PostgreSQL - Flexible Server:

This diagram from Microsoft illustrates how the authentication process works.

as per this diagram we can create two categories of roles/users

```sh
#postgreSQL side
PostgreSQL Admin
PostgreSQL user

# Azure AD side 
Azure AD PostgreSQL Admin
Azure AD PostgreSQL user

```
## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this lab, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Azure subscription.
1. Azure database for PostgreSQL Flexible server already created
1. Basic knowledge of PostgreSQL Flexible server

## Implementation details

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to streamlining PostgreSQL Database access control permissions with Azure AD Groups.


## Task-1: Enable Azure AD Authentication

In this task, we will enable Azure AD authentication by configuring the Azure AD settings on the PostgreSQL servers.


## Task-2: Create Azure AD administrator group for PostgreSQL database
Creating an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group for PostgreSQL database administrators involves establishing a dedicated group within the Azure AD to manage permissions and access control for users who is responsible for PostgreSQL administration activities.

Only one Microsoft Entra administrator (a user or group) can be configured for an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server at any time.

Only a Microsoft Entra administrator for PostgreSQL can initially connect to the Azure Database for PostgreSQL using a Microsoft Entra account. The Active Directory administrator can configure subsequent Microsoft Entra database users.


## Task-3: Create Azure AD Groups
This step involves creating Azure AD groups to efficiently manage access permissions for application developers working with 'database1' across different environments. These groups play a pivotal role in streamlining the assignment of access privileges, promoting a structured and secure approach to database management.

**Azure AD Group Configuration:**

*Development Environment:*

- `psql-dev-database1-readonly`: Read-only access group during development.
- `psql-dev-database1-readwrite`: Read and write access group for developers during development.
- `psql-dev-database1-administrators`: Administrative rights group for 'database1' in the development environment.

*Testing Environment:*

- `psql-test-database1-readonly`: Read-only access group during testing.
- `psql-test-database1-readwrite`: Read and write access group for developers during testing.
- `psql-test-database1-administrators`: Administrative rights group for 'database1' in the testing environment.

*Production Environment:*

- `psql-prod-database1-readonly`: Read-only access group in the production environment.
- `psql-prod-database1-readwrite`: Read and write access group for developers in the production environment.
- `psql-prod-database1-administrators`: Administrative rights group for 'database1' in the production environment.


## Task-4: Mapping Grants to Azure AD Roles:

In this step, we define specific roles and associated access privileges for 'database1.' These roles ensure a granular control mechanism, aligning permissions with distinct user responsibilities.

Read-Only Role

- **Role Name:** `psql-dev-database1-readonly`
- **Purpose:** This role is designed for users who require read-only access to 'database1.' Members of this group can only execute SELECT queries.
- **Grants:**
  - `SELECT`: Allows users in this role to retrieve data from tables within 'database1.'

Read-Write Role

- **Role Name:** `psql-dev-database1-readwrite`
- **Purpose:** This role is intended for users with the need to read and modify data in 'database1.'
- **Grants:**
  - `SELECT`: Permits users to retrieve data.
  - `INSERT`: Allows users to add new records.
  - `UPDATE`: Enables users to modify existing records.
  - `DELETE`: Grants the ability to remove records.

Administrator Role

- **Role Name:** `psql-dev-database1-administrator`
- **Purpose:** This high-privilege role is specifically reserved for database architects and administrators with comprehensive control over 'database1.'
- **Grants:**
  - `SELECT`: Allows for data retrieval.
  - `INSERT`: Permits the addition of new records.
  - `UPDATE`: Enables modification of existing records.
  - `DELETE`: Grants the ability to remove records.
  - `TRUNCATE`: Provides the authority to remove all records from a table.
  - `REFERENCES`: Allows the creation of foreign key references.
  - `TRIGGER`: Permits the creation of triggers.
  - `CREATE`: Enables the creation of database objects.
  - `CONNECT`: Grants the ability to connect to the database.
  - `TEMPORARY`: Allows the creation of temporary tables.
  - `EXECUTE`: Enables the execution of stored procedures and functions.
  - `USAGE`: Permits the usage of database objects.
  - `SET`: Allows the setting of configuration parameters.
  - `ALTER SYSTEM`: Enables modifications to the system configuration.
