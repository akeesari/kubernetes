## Introduction

Getting your application ready to run on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) involves a series of steps to ensure a smooth deployment. Here's an overview of the process:

**1. Create a new .NET Core Web API project:**
Start by creating a new .NET Core Web API project. Think of it as a foundation for your app.

**2. Containerization of your application:**
Start by containerizing your application. Containerization allows your application to run consistently across different environments.
   
**3. Pushing the containerized application to Azure Container Registry (ACR):**
To make your container image accessible to AKS, you need to store it in a container registry like Azure Container Registry (ACR).

## Implementation details

Step by step implementation details of getting application ready to run on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

## Step-1: Create a new .NET Core Web API project

To create a new .NET Core Web API project, you will need to have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine. You can download the .NET Core SDK from the .NET website <https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download>.

Once you have the .NET Core SDK installed, follow these steps to create a new .NET Core Web API project:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
2. Run the `dotnet new` command to create a new .NET Core Web API project:
Let's take a look some useful `dotnet` command before creating the project.
Use this command to get the `dotnet` commands help so that your get idea on how use these commands better. 
```
dotnet --help
```
Use this command to get list of available `dotnet` project templates
```
dotnet new --list
```
output

```
These templates matched your input: 

Template Name                                 Short Name           Language    Tags
--------------------------------------------  -------------------  ----------  -------------------------------------

.
and more....
```
Use this command to actually create new project
```
dotnet new webapi -o aspnetapi

or 
dotnet new webapi -o aspnetapi --no-https -f net7.0

cd aspnetapi

code . 

or 
code -r ../aspnetapi
```
Output
```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>cd C:\Source\Repos

C:\Source\Repos>dotnet new webapi -o aspnetapi
The template "ASP.NET Core Web API" was created successfully.

```
3. Here is the example of adding packages to .net projects.
```
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory
```
4. Run the following command to restore the project's dependencies:
```
dotnet restore
```


## Step-2: Test the new .NET core Web API project

1.  Run the following command to build the project:
 `dotnet build` command will look for the project or solution file in the current directory and compile the code in it. It will also restore any dependencies required by the project and create the output files in the bin directory.
```
dotnet build
```
output
```

Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)

Time Elapsed 00:00:01.51
```
2.  Run the following command to start the development server:
 `dotnet run` command will look for the project or solution file in the current directory and compile the code in it. After compiling, it will run the application and any output will be displayed in the console.
```
dotnet run
```
output
```
Building...

```
You will notice the URL in the output, copy the URL and paste it in your favorite browser. you will get a `404 error. ` donâ€™t worry. Just type swagger at the end of the URL and press enter and you will get the following webpage.

![image.jpg](images/image-17.jpg)

- <https://localhost:7136>

- <https://localhost:7136/swagger/index.html> - Swagger URL

- <https://localhost:7136/api/aspnetapi/v1/weatherforecast> - API endpoint URL

If you are able to see this swagger URL in your browser then everything is created and setup as expected.

![image.jpg](images/image-18.jpg)

Use the following command to stop the application in VS Code
```
ctrl + c
```
It is time to push your basic project template source into Azure DevOps Git repo.

Use these git commands to push the source code.

```sh
git add .
git commit -am "My fist commit - Create Web API project"
git push
```

## Step-3: Add Dockerfiles to the API project

Dockerfiles will be added to the project, which provide instructions for building a container image of our Web API application.

There are multiple way to create `Dockerfile` depending on your code editor. 
Here are the step-by-step instructions for creating a `Dockerfile` in a .NET Core Web API project:

1. First, open your .NET Core Web API project in Visual Studio code or your favorite code editor.
1. Next, create a new file in the root directory of your project and name it Dockerfile (with no file extension).
1. Open the Dockerfile and add the following code to the file:
``` Dockerfile
#See https://aka.ms/containerfastmode to understand how Visual Studio uses this Dockerfile to build your images for faster debugging.

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["AspNetApi.csproj", "."]
RUN dotnet restore "./AspNetApi.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/."
RUN dotnet build "AspNetApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "AspNetApi.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "AspNetApi.dll"]
```
This code defines a Docker image that is based on the aspnet:6.0 image from Microsoft's container registry. The image is divided into four stages:

   - `base:` sets up the working directory and exposes port 80.
   - `build:` restores the project dependencies, builds the project in Release mode, and copies the build output to the /app/build directory.
   - `publish:` publishes the project in Release mode and copies the published output to the /app/publish directory.
   - `final:` sets the working directory to `/app` and copies the published output from the `publish` stage to the current directory. It also specifies the entry point for the container, which is the `dotnet` command with the name of your project's DLL file.


## Step-4: Build & Test docker container locally

We will build the Docker container locally using the Dockerfiles and ensure that the containerized application functions as expected.

`docker build` is a command that allows you to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for Docker to build the image, including the base image to use, the files to include, the commands to run, and the ports to expose.

To build and publish a container image for a .NET Core Web API project, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from the Docker website <https://www.docker.com/get-started>.

Once you have Docker installed, follow these steps to build and publish a container for your .NET Core Web API project:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root of the project.
2. Run the `docker build` command to build the Docker image:
```
docker build -t sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1 .
```
output
```

```
**Verify the new image**

if you open the docker desktop you should be able to see the newly created image there.
![image.jpg](images/image-19.jpg)
3. Run the `docker run` command to start a container based on the image:
```
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1
```
output
```
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[14]  
      Now listening on: http://[::]:80

      Hosting environment: Production
info: Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime[0]
      Content root path: /app/
```
Wait for the container to start. You should see output in the terminal indicating that the container is listening on port 80.
Open the docker desktop to see the newly created container in the docker desktop app

Open a web browser and navigate to <http://localhost:8080/api/values> (or whatever URL corresponds to your Web API endpoint) to confirm that the Web API is running inside the Docker container.

use these links for testing when you run docker command from vs code

!!! Best-Practice
    When working with Docker containers, it is recommended to follow a consistent naming convention to ensure clarity and organization. The following pattern is suggested for naming Docker containers:

```sh
docker build -t projectname/domainname/appname:yyyymmdd.sequence .

example:
docker build -t project1/sample/aspnet-api:20230226 .
```

You've successfully created a Dockerfile and built a Docker image for your .NET Core Web API project. You can now distribute the Docker image to other machines or deploy it to a cloud service like Azure or AWS.


## Step-5: Publish docker container to ACR

Finally, we will publish the built Docker container to the Azure Container Registry (ACR), making it accessible for deployment and distribution.

Now we've Docker Containers ready for push to Container Registry so that we can use them in future labs.

To publish a Docker container image to Azure Container Registry (ACR), you will need to have the following:

1. Create an Azure Container Registry. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the instructions in the Azure Portal or using Azure CLI. As part of the Chapter-2 we will create this azure resource, you can come back to this steps after ACR is created.
1. Log in to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
``` sh
# azure Login
az login

# set the azure subscription
az account set -s "anji.keesari"

# Log in to the container registry
az acr login --name acr1dev

# To get the login server address for verification
az acr list --resource-group rg-acr-dev --query "[].{acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table

# output should look similar to this.

# AcrLoginServer    
# ------------------
# acr1dev.azurecr.io
```
1. `Tag` your Docker container with the full name of your Azure Container Registry, including the repository name and the version tag. You can do this by running the following command:
```
docker tag sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1 acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1
```
Use this command to see a list of your current local images
```
docker images
```
output
```
REPOSITORY                             TAG          IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api   20230226.1   1bab8ba123ca   2 hours ago     213MB
```
1. Push your Docker container to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
```
docker push acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1
```
output
```
The push refers to repository [acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api]

```
5. Wait for the push to complete. Depending on the size of your Docker container and the speed of your internet connection, this may take a few minutes.
5. Verify the newly pushed image to ACR.
``` sh
# List images in registry
az acr repository list --name acr1dev --output table
```
output
```
Result
-------------------------------
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet
mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk
sample/aspnet-api
```
6. Show the new tags of a image in the acr
``` sh
az acr repository show-tags --name acr1dev --repository sample/aspnet-api --output table
```
output
```
Result
----------
20230220.1
20230226.1
```

You've successfully pushed your Docker container to Azure Container Registry. You can now use the Azure Portal or Azure CLI to manage your container and deploy them to Azure services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Step-6: Pull docker container from ACR

Pull docker container from ACR is something may be helpful during container troubleshooting.

To pull a Docker container from Azure Container Registry (ACR), you need to perform the following steps:


1. Log in to your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
``` sh
# Log in to the container registry
az acr login --name acr1dev
```
1. Pull your Docker container from your Azure Container Registry using the Docker command-line interface. You can do this by running the following command:
``` sh
docker pull acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230226.1
```
output
```
