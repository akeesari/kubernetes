# Creating YAML Manifests for Microservice-1 in AKS

## Introduction

In this lab, we will look into the process of creating plain YAML manifest files to deploy a microservice, specifically the "aspnet-api," within an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster. This practical exercise serves as an essential step towards understanding the fundamentals of Kubernetes configuration through YAML manifests. By manually applying these manifests using the `kubectl` command, we ensure that our microservice operates correctly within the AKS cluster. Moreover, this groundwork paves the way for future endeavors wherein we'll learn to encapsulate these configurations as Helm charts for streamlined deployment.

## Implementation Details

Throughout this exercise, we will accomplish the following objectives:

- **Step-1:** Create deployment manifest
- **Step-2:** Create service manifest
- **Step-3:** Create ingress manifest
- **Step-4:** Deploy manifest files in AKS
- **Step-5:** Test Microservice-1 running in AKS
  
## Step 1: Create Deployment Manifest

We'll begin by creating a deployment manifest for the "aspnet-api" microservice. This YAML file will outline the deployment's desired characteristics, such as the number of replicas, update strategy, and container specifications. By defining these attributes, we establish a clear blueprint for Kubernetes on how to deploy and manage our microservice.

Here's an example of the deployment manifest:

``` yaml title="deployment.yaml"
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: aspnet-api
  namespace: sample
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: aspnet-api
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 1
  minReadySeconds: 5
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: aspnet-api
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        "kubernetes.io/os": linux
      serviceAccountName: default
      containers:
        - name: aspnet-api
          image: acr1dev.azurecr.io/sample/aspnet-api:20230323.15
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          ports:
            - name: http
              containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
```

## Step 2: Create Service Manifest

In this step, we'll craft a service manifest for the "aspnet-api" microservice. The service manifest specifies how external traffic should access our microservice. This YAML file defines the service's type, ports, and labels, enabling Kubernetes to manage network communication effectively.

Here's an example of the service manifest:

``` yaml title="service.yaml"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: aspnet-api
  namespace: sample
  labels: {}
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
      name: http
  selector:
    app: aspnet-api
```

## Step 3: Create Ingress Manifest

This step involves creating an ingress manifest, which outlines how external traffic will be routed to our microservice within the AKS cluster. The ingress configuration includes details about the host, paths, and backend services, effectively handling the external access.


``` yaml title="ingress.yaml"
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: nginx-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/ssl-redirect: "false"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/use-regex: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /aspnet/api/* # aspnet svc rest api calls
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: aspnet-api
            port:
              number: 80
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
      - ip: 20.62.213.32
# kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n sample
```

## Step 4: Deploy Manifest Files in AKS

With our deployment, service, and potentially ingress manifests ready, it's time to apply these configurations to the AKS cluster. We can accomplish this by using the `kubectl apply` command along with the respective YAML files.

```sh
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n sample
kubectl apply -f service.yaml -n sample
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -n sample
```


```sh
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/aspnet-api-79b4cbf4bb-54cng           1/1     Running   0          18h

NAME                         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP    PORT(S)        AGE
service/aspnet-api           LoadBalancer   10.25.69.201    20.62.213.32   80:32204/TCP   166d

NAME                                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/aspnet-api           1/1     1            1           18h

NAME                                            DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/aspnet-api-79b4cbf4bb           1         1         1       18h
```


## Step 5: Test Microservice-1 Running in AKS

Upon successfully applying the manifest files, we can test the functionality of our "aspnet-api" microservice within the AKS cluster. This step involves accessing the microservice through its designated URL and ensuring its proper operation.

## Conclusion

Through this hands-on exercise, we've gained insight into defining deployments, services, and ingress using simple YAML files. This foundational knowledge forms the basis for further exploration, such as packaging these configurations as Helm charts for more efficient deployment in the future.
