To troubleshoot an AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) pod, you can follow these steps:

## Azure login

```
az login
```

## Set subscription
```
az account set -s "ewm3 test"
```
## Connect to k8s cluster

```
az aks get-credentials -g "rg-rgname-dev" -n "aks-clustername-dev"
```

## Verify the pod status

```
kubectl get pods -n sample
kubectl get svc -n sample
```

## Describe the pod

```
 kubectl describe pod/aspnet-api-576c6988f-jcq42 -n sample
```

## Check the logs

Use command to view the logs generated by the pod and its containers. This can give you valuable information about what is causing the issue with the pod.

```
kubectl logs pod/aspnet-api-576c6988f-jcq42 -n sample
```

## Debug the container

This command allows you to execute a command in a container in a pod.

```
kubectl exec -n tenant1 -it nginx-6595874d85-r6zpn -- bash
# or
kubectl exec -n tenant1 -it nginx-6595874d85-r6zpn -- /bin/sh
# or
kubectl exec -n tenant1 -it nginx-6595874d85-r6zpn -- sh
```
## install curl

install following tools as per the need
```
apt-get -y update; apt-get -y install curl
```

## curl internal pod URL

```
curl http://aspnet-api.namespace.svc.cluster.local:80/aspnetapi
```

## Restart the pod:

```
kubectl delete pod/aspnet-api-576c6988f-jcq42 -n sample
```
<!--
## scale up or down

If the issue is related to resource constraints, you can scale up or down the replicas of the deployment using the kubectl scale command.

-->
It's also important to keep in mind that the troubleshooting steps may vary depending on the specific problem with the pod.
