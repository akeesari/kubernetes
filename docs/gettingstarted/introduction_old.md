Welcome to the world of containerized microservices and Kubernetes, where scalability, flexibility, and reliability are most important in modern application development. In recent years, microservices architecture has become increasingly popular as a way to build complex applications that are scalable, reliable, and maintainable. Microservices architecture breaks down large applications into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and agility.

However, managing microservices can be challenging, particularly when it comes to deployment and scaling. Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications and has become the standard for deploying microservices. Kubernetes provides a robust platform for managing containerized applications, but it can be complex to set up and manage.

In this book, "Building Scalable Kubernetes Infrastructure for Microservices," I will show you how to tackle these challenges and successfully build and deploy containerized microservices applications on Kubernetes using ArgoCD and Helm. ArgoCD is a powerful continuous delivery tool that simplifies the deployment of Kubernetes applications. Helm, on the other hand, is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to deploy and manage complex applications.

Throughout this book, I will guide you step by step, providing detailed instructions and practical examples, making it accessible to developers, DevSecOps engineers, and IT professionals. Whether you are new to containerized microservices or have prior experience, this book will helps you with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage the full potential of microservices on Kubernetes using ArgoCD and Helm.

The implementation guide within this book serves as your reference architecture for creating, deploying, and managing your microservices architecture with Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) using ArgoCD and Helm's CI/CD DevOps process. You will learn how to create multiple microservice applications with different technology stacks, containerize these microservices, push them to Azure Container Registry (ACR), and finally deploy them to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Additionally, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of deploying microservice applications to AKS using ArgoCD and Helm Charts.

Get ready to start on a journey of mastering microservice deployment on Kubernetes with ArgoCD and Helm. Let's look into the true potential of cloud-native development!

## Organization of this Book:

At a high level, this book is organized into a total of six chapters, each featuring multiple exercises or labs designed to enhance your understanding.

**Chapter 1: Building Containerized Microservices** 

In this first chapter, "Building Containerized Microservices" we will explore the fundamental concepts of microservices, Docker, and dev containers. Additionally, we explore microservices implementation patterns utilizing Azure DevOps Git repositories. I will guide you through the process of creating multiple containerized microservices applications employing various technology stacks. The chapter covers essential topics such as organizing your code in Git repositories, Dockerizing applications with Dockerfiles, and pushing Docker containers to container registries.

Throughout the exercises, we will create microservices using different technologies, including .NET Core, Node.js, and React.js. Additionally, we'll delve into the creation of containerized databases, such as SQL Server and PostgreSQL. The containerized microservices applications developed in this chapter will form the foundational basis for subsequent labs.

**Chapter 2: Create Azure Infrastructure with Terraform** 

In this second chapter, "Create Azure Infrastructure with Terraform," we look into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and the benefits it brings. Focusing on Terraform as our IaC tool, we explore its setup and address the crucial task of hosting containerized microservices applications.

Using Terraform, I guide you through the creation of essential Azure cloud resources. These include a Log Analytics workspace, Virtual Network, Azure Container Registry (ACR), Application Gateway, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure PostgreSQL Database, Azure Key Vault, Azure Redis Cache, Azure Storage Account, Azure Event Hubs, and the setup of Front Door and CDN profiles. The goal is to automate the infrastructure creation process comprehensively, adhering to best practices in infrastructure management.

**Chapter 3: Prepare Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for Microservices** 

In this third chapter, we delve into the details of preparing applications for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). The focus is on deploying a .NET Core API and containerized microservices applications to AKS, complemented by hands-on experience in managing AKS clusters using kubectl. Additionally, we explore the setup of NGINX ingress controller, Application Gateway ingress controller (AGIC), and Cert-Manager in AKS using Terraform.

This chapter also covered the issuance of Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates to enhance website security, addresses the integration of Azure Key Vault with AKS, offering robust security measures. Kubernetes Pod troubleshooting techniques are detailed, ensuring a comprehensive understanding. The chapter concludes by guiding you through the creation of a new user node pool in AKS, providing valuable insights into upgrading or resizing node pools. By the end of this chapter, you will possess the knowledge and skills required to proficiently manage containerized applications within a Kubernetes environment.

**Chapter 4: Microservices CI/CD with Azure DevOps**

In the fourth chapter, "Microservices CI/CD with Azure DevOps," we will look into the world of DevOps and its relevance to microservices. We will discuss DevOps best practices and outline a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery/Deployment) strategy specifically tailored for microservices on Kubernetes. Furthermore, you will learn how to create DevOps pipelines for each of your microservices applications, ensuring streamlined and automated software delivery.

**Chapter 5: Helm: Managing Kubernetes Deployments**

Chapter 5 will introduce you to Helm, a powerful package manager for Kubernetes. We will start by creating basic Helm charts and familiarizing ourselves with frequently used Helm commands. You will then learn how to convert the basic Helm charts for your microservices applications and package them for easy deployment. Additionally, we will explore pushing Helm charts to a container registry and deploying them effectively in a Kubernetes environment.

**Chapter 6: ArgoCD: Continuous Deployment for Kubernetes**

The final chapter, "ArgoCD: Continuous Deployment for Kubernetes," will introduce you to ArgoCD, a robust continuous delivery tool specifically designed for Kubernetes environments. I will cover the installation of ArgoCD and its command-line interface (CLI). You will gain insights into creating projects, repositories, and applications within ArgoCD, enabling seamless deployment of your microservices. Furthermore, we will explore how to deploy Helm charts using ArgoCD, ensuring efficient and controlled application deployments.
