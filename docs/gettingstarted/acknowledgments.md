# Acknowledgments

Writing a book is a collaborative effort, and I could not have done it without the help and support of many people.

First, I want to express my gratitude to my family—your patience, understanding, and constant encouragement gave me the time and focus needed to bring this project to life. Thank you for believing in me even during the late nights and long weekends.

During this book writing I had to refer lot of online materials, I would also like to thank the many individuals and organizations who have contributed to the development of Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform, and containerization technologies. Without their hard work and dedication, this book would not be possible.

Finally, to the readers—thank you for investing your time in this book. I hope it becomes a valuable guide in your own journey to building scalable and resilient cloud infrastructure.
