## **Building Scalable Cloud Infrastructure for Microservices**

*— with real-world labs using Azure and Terraform*

---

In the modern era of cloud computing, microservices have become the backbone of scalable and resilient application architectures. However, building the infrastructure to support these microservices—securely, reliably, and at scale—remains one of the most complex challenges in DevOps and cloud engineering. This book is created to come out of those challenges.

As an architect deeply involved in designing and deploying enterprise-grade solutions on Microsoft Azure, I’ve seen how important it is to automate infrastructure provisioning using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Terraform, as a powerful IaC tool, has become a critical asset in managing cloud resources efficiently, reducing human error, and enabling repeatable, version-controlled infrastructure deployments.

This book is a practical guide for architects, DevOps engineers, developers, and anyone who wants to master the art of building cloud infrastructure to support microservices at scale. I focus on real-world scenarios and hands-on labs using **Microsoft Azure** and **Terraform** to provision key cloud components like:

* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Virtual Networks
* PostgreSQL Flexible Server
* Azure Key Vault
* Event Hubs for Kafka
* Redis Cache
* Front Door and CDN
* Log Analytics and Monitoring

Each lab builds progressively toward a fully functional microservices environment—deployed entirely via code.

While this book emphasizes Azure and Terraform, the principles you’ll learn—modularization, automation, environment management, and cloud-native best practices—are applicable across cloud platforms and tools.

I’ve written this book not only to share technical skills, but also to help you think like an architect: how to structure your infrastructure, optimize your deployments, secure your data, and design for scale and maintainability.

Whether you're beginning your journey with cloud-native infrastructure or looking to refine your skills, I hope this book provides you with the insights, confidence, and practical experience needed to succeed.

Let’s get started on building scalable cloud infrastructure for the future.
