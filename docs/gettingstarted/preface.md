**Building Scalable Kubernetes Infrastructure for Microservices**

*— with real-world labs using Azure and Terraform*

In today’s fast-moving cloud landscape, microservices have become the preferred architecture for building scalable, resilient applications. But designing and deploying the infrastructure to support those services—securely, reliably, and at scale—is still one of the toughest challenges in cloud engineering. That’s what inspired this book.

Over the years, working as a cloud architect on large-scale solutions built on Microsoft Azure, I’ve seen first-hand the critical role that automation plays in building sustainable infrastructure. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a key practice, and among the tools available, Terraform stands out for its power, flexibility, and cloud-agnostic approach.

This book is written for architects, DevOps professionals, developers, and cloud engineers who want a practical, hands-on guide to building infrastructure that can support microservices effectively. Using real-world labs and examples, I’ll walk you through how to use Terraform to provision essential Azure services such as:

* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
* Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Virtual Networks
* PostgreSQL Flexible Server
* Azure Key Vault
* Event Hubs for Kafka
* Redis Cache
* Azure Front Door and CDN
* Log Analytics and Monitoring

Each lab builds on the previous one, gradually leading you toward a complete, production-ready microservices environment—fully provisioned through code.

While the focus of this book is on Azure and Terraform, the concepts—automation, modularization, repeatability, and security—are broadly applicable across any cloud platform or infrastructure stack.

More than just code, I want this book to help you think like a systems architect. You’ll learn how to design infrastructure that scales, how to automate repeatable processes, how to secure cloud workloads, and how to keep operations simple and maintainable in the long run.

Whether you’re just starting out in the world of cloud-native infrastructure or looking to sharpen your existing skills, I hope this book becomes a valuable companion on your journey.
