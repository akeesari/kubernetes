Welcome to the world of containerized microservices and Kubernetes, where scalability, flexibility, and reliability are most important in modern application development. In recent years, microservices architecture has become increasingly popular as a way to build complex applications that are scalable, reliable, and maintainable. Microservices architecture breaks down large applications into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, allowing for greater flexibility and agility.

However, managing microservices can be challenging, particularly when it comes to deployment and scaling. Kubernetes is a powerful tool for managing containerized applications and has become the standard for deploying microservices. Kubernetes provides a robust platform for managing containerized applications, but it can be complex to set up and manage.

This book is about building that infrastructure.

You’ll learn how to provision, secure, and scale essential cloud components on **Microsoft Azure**, using **Terraform**, one of the most widely adopted Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools. By the end of this journey, you’ll not only understand the technical how-to but also develop the architectural thinking needed to support modern applications in production environments.

Throughout this book, I will guide you step by step, providing detailed instructions and practical examples, making it accessible to developers, DevSecOps engineers, and IT professionals. Whether you are new to containerized microservices or have prior experience, this book will helps you with the knowledge and skills necessary to leverage the full potential of microservices on Kubernetes Infrastructure.

The implementation guide within this book serves as your reference architecture for creating Scalable Kubernetes Cloud Infrastructure for Microservices architecture using Azure and Terraform.


## Why Azure and Terraform?

Azure is a leading enterprise cloud platform with services like container-based and distributed workloads. Its managed Kubernetes service—**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**—offers a powerful foundation for deploying microservices.

Terraform, on the other hand, provides a declarative, consistent way to define and deploy cloud infrastructure using code. Together, Azure and Terraform offer the ability to:

* Automate and version-control infrastructure provisioning
* Create repeatable environments across dev, test, preprod, and production
* Rapidly deploy and scale microservices with full governance and observability
* Reduce manual errors and improve operational consistency

This book bridges the gap between theory and hands-on application using these tools.


## Who Should Read This Book

This book is for a wide audience of technology professionals:

* **Cloud Engineers** and **DevOps Practitioners** who want hands-on experience provisioning and managing infrastructure with Terraform on Azure
* **Developers** building microservices who want to better understand the underlying infrastructure
* **Solutions Architects** looking to implement scalable, cloud-native architecture using Infrastructure as Code
* **IT professionals or students** transitioning into cloud and DevOps roles

I will expect basic prior experience with Terraform is required, and familiarity with Azure and general DevOps principles will help.


## What You’ll Learn

Through structured chapters and labs, you will:

* Understand the fundamentals of Infrastructure as Code
* Set up Terraform to manage Azure infrastructure
* Provision essential cloud services: AKS, ACR, PostgreSQL, Redis, Key Vault, Event Hubs, and more
* Build secure and network-aware cloud environments
* Manage configurations across environments (Dev, Test, PreProd & Prod)
* Integrate logging, monitoring, and diagnostics
* Prepare for real-world scenarios with production-readiness practices

## How This Book Is Structured

The book is designed to be **lab-driven**, with each chapter building on the previous one. You’ll begin by setting up your Terraform environment, then incrementally provision each component of a scalable microservices infrastructure.

Each lab includes:

* A clear goal and purpose
* Terraform code walkthroughs
* Step-by-step deployment instructions
* Screenshots, CLI commands, and validation checks
* Tips and best practices
* Clean-up guidance to manage cost and clutter

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

* An active **Azure subscription** (Free Tier is sufficient for most labs)
* Required permissions in Azure subscription (Global Administrator permissions recommended)
* **Terraform installed** on your local machine
* Basic understanding of Azure cloud, Kubernetes and container concepts 
* Access to a terminal or command-line interface (PowerShell, Bash, etc.)
